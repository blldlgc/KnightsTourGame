        <Label Text="1. The game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard, with a knight piece initially placed on any square."/>
        <Label Text="2. The knight moves in an L shape: two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically), followed by one square perpendicular to the previous direction."/>
        <Label Text="3. Players take turns moving the knight."/>
        <Label Text="4. Each move must adhere to the knight's movement rules and cannot revisit a square already visited."/>
        <Label Text=""/>

        <Label 
    Text="Gameplay:"
     />
        <Label Text="1. Start the game by placing the knight on any square of the chessboard."/>
        <Label Text="2. On each turn, the player selects a valid destination square for the knight to move."/>
        <Label Text="3. The game continues until the knight has visited every square exactly once."/>
        <Label Text="4. If the knight cannot make a legal move, the game ends."/>
        <Label Text=""/>
        
        <Label 
    Text="End of the Game:"
     />
        <Label 
    Text="1. The game ends when the knight has visited every square on the chessboard exactly once."/>
        <Label Text="2. Players can track their progress by counting the number of squares visited."/>
        <Label Text="3. The ultimate goal is to achieve a closed tour, where the knight ends its journey on the square it started from."/>
        <Label Text=""/>
        <Label Text="Tips:"/>
        <Label Text="1. Plan your knight's moves strategically to ensure you can visit every square."/>
        <Label Text="2. Look for patterns and try to visualize the knight's path across the chessboard."/>
        <Label Text="3. Practice and patience are key to mastering Knight's Tour."/>
